Sometimes, we need to make sure that all the required dependencies are set to the spring bean. 
Spring provides @Required annotation to check spring dependencies. If the required dependencies are 
not set, then it throws BeanInitializationException

Here is the xml based configuration, make sure that you are adding <context:annotation-config /> 
tag and yu are registering RequiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor in your spring configurations to enable
 @Required annotation.
 
To disable or skip the @Required annotation for a class we can configure the bean definition with a meta 
element with the org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.RequiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor.skipRequiredCheck 
and assign a value of true. This will skip the required annotation completely for that class.
